        I am your inheritance, your grandmother’s legacy. I am yours to command.
       
       Suraya is delighted when her witch grandmother gifts her a pelesit. 
       She names her ghostly companion Pink, and the two quickly become inseparable.
       
       But Suraya doesn’t know that pelesits have a dark side—and when
        Pink’s shadows threaten to consume them both, they must find enough light
         tosurvive . . . before they are both lost to the darkness.
       
       Fans of Holly Black’s Doll Bones and Tahereh Mafi’s Furthermore series will love
        this ghostly middle grade debut that explores jealousy, love, and the extraordinary power of friendship..";
